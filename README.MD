## INTRODUCTION

<b>MOSTEDGE</b> is a cloud based mobile c-store back office product. This app allows store owners to monitor store transactions, check sales data, update item prices and much more. Welcome to a whole new way of looking at your business on the go, anytime, anywhere.

## CHALLENGE

One of the key challenges I encountered during development was implementing a wide variety of chart types, while also designing an interactive 2D plan with item dropdowns. Additionally, incorporating draggable items across multiple pages presented a complex task, requiring careful attention to user experience and functionality.

## SOLUTION
I successfully overcame these challenges by customizing [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/index) to implement a diverse range of charts and utilizing [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com/), a powerful canvas library, to develop the 2D drawing plan. These solutions not only enhanced functionality but also optimized the overall user experience.

## RESULTS

The app empowers business owners to efficiently manage their inventories, items, and orders, while providing users with a seamless experience to place orders. It features an interactive 2D shop layout with item dropdowns for enhanced visualization. Additionally, the app offers comprehensive analytics, allowing users to generate insightful reports through various chart types and data tables, with filtering options by date, week, quarter, year, and custom date ranges. This ensures businesses can make data-driven decisions with ease.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

- <b>Framework</b>: Ionic/Angular, Capacitor
